Welcome to Django-hstore-flattenfields's documentation!
=======================================================

Django-hstore-flattenfields is an alternative for who want to have a Dynamic Scheme in Django without rely on a NoSQL database. Django-hstore-flattenfields add "dynamic fields" in Django Models, using the Hstore extension built in the PostgreSQL v9.1+. This way you can quickly add new fields in a Model, with some great features.

Django-hstore-flattenfields is built and used in the Multmeio enterprise.
